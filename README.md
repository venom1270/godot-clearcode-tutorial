## Remarks

A great resource for learning general gamedev principles and approches.

It still contains some bugs and/or unfinished elements, namely:

- missing Hunter hit shader and sounds
- Hunter pathfinding not polished
- Drone hit and explosion audio not playing
- different object interactions are not properly tested
- no win/lose condition
- probably many more...
